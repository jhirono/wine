- Select wine bottle photos from your photo library
- Full-screen image viewing capability
- Analyze wines using OpenAI's GPT-4o model with advanced prompt engineering
- View comprehensive wine information including:
  - Wine name with special designations and cuv√©e names
  - Winery/producer with historical context
  - Vintage details with quality assessment for that year
  - Specific regions, sub-regions, and appellations
  - Country of origin
  - Grape varieties with approximate percentages
  - Alcohol content
  - Detailed wine style and body characteristics
  - Rich tasting notes with primary, secondary, and tertiary flavors
  - Creative and specific food pairing suggestions
  - Critics' scores with specific rating sources
  - Aging potential and drinking window recommendations
