## Technical Specifications

### Image Recognition and Processing
- The app will use device camera to capture high-quality images of wine bottles.
- Multiple images (front, back, label close-ups) should be supported for each wine entry.
- GPT-4o will be used to analyze wine label photos with expected 95% accuracy for extracting detailed wine information.
- Minimal pre-processing of images will be required due to GPT-4o's robust image recognition capabilities.

### AI Data Extraction
The system will leverage GPT-4o to extract and store the following information from wine labels:
- Winery/Producer
- Wine name
- Vintage
- Region and country of origin
- Grape varieties
- Alcohol content
- Wine style/type
- Critics' scores (if available)
- Tasting notes from the producer
- Food pairing suggestions
- Aging potential

### Database Structure
The app will utilize a cloud database with local caching to store:
- User profile and preferences
- Wine collection details
- Consumption history
- Tasting notes and personal ratings
- Recommendation history

### User Interface
- The app will feature a modern, visually appealing interface optimized for ease of use.
- The home screen will display collection statistics and recent additions.
- A visual "cellar view" will provide an intuitive representation of the user's collection.
- Powerful search and filter functions will help users locate specific wines quickly.
- Detail views will display comprehensive information about each wine.

### Wine Recommendation Engine
- The recommendation system will rely directly on GPT-4o for generating personalized wine suggestions.
- Food pairing recommendations will utilize GPT-4o's knowledge of established wine pairing principles.
- The system will provide context from the user's collection and preferences to GPT-4o to improve recommendation relevance.
- No complex machine learning infrastructure required as GPT-4o handles the recommendation intelligence.

## Security and Privacy
- Basic data protection measures will be implemented.
- User authentication to protect wine collection data.
- Simple backup and restore functionality.
- Standard app privacy policy.
- Given the non-sensitive nature of wine information, extensive security features are not prioritized.

## Integration Points
- Integration with wine databases for supplementary information
- Social sharing capabilities for recommendations and discoveries
- Optional connectivity with wine merchants for purchase suggestions
- Calendar integration for planning meals and selecting appropriate wines

## Future Enhancements (v2.0+)
- Community features: sharing collections, recommendations, and reviews with friends
- Marketplace integration: finding and purchasing wines directly through the app
- Augmented reality features: pointing camera at wine shelves for real-time information overlay
- Wine event notifications: local tastings, wine club activities, etc.
- Integration with smart cellar management systems and temperature monitoring
- Barcode/QR code scanning as an alternative to image recognition
- Advanced cost optimization through machine learning-based wine identification without GPT-4o
- Crowdsourced wine information database from user inputs
- Offline mode for basic functionality without requiring API calls
